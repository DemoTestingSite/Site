# Overview

## AD2 Signal & Waveform Generation

### Purpose & Vision
Digital Automation Technology (DAT) has developed a **LabVIEW-based, cross-platform application** for **robust, flexible, and precise analog signal and waveform generation** using the **DAT USB-powered Oscilloscope and Arbitrary Waveform Generation Platform**.  
The solution extends traditional function-generation capabilities with advanced features like **noise synthesis**, **arbitrary waveform handling**, and **real-time configurability**.

### Core Capabilities
- **Periodic Waveforms**: sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, pulse, DC, rectified sine.
- **Arbitrary Waveforms (AWG)**: CSV import, mathematical expressions, long-duration streaming.
- **Noise Injection**: white/Gaussian, pink (1/f), brown, burst/impulse, band-limited, custom profiles.
- **Modulation & Composition**: AM/FM/PM, multi-tone, chirps, gated sequences, envelopes.
- **Real-Time Control**: dynamic parameter updates, start/stop, run-length/repeat, channel sync & phase.
- **Hardware Front-End**: filtering, impedance matching, buffering, level shifting, protection for DUT safety.

### Analytics Companion
- **Deep Statistics**: mean, variance, RMS, skewness, kurtosis; visualizations like histograms and Q–Q plots.
- **Signal Stability (SPC)**: Shewhart, EWMA, CUSUM charts with real-time alerts.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: correlation, joint PDFs, mutual information, persistence heatmaps.

### Why Analog-Only?
Focusing on analog outputs ensures **real-world stimulus fidelity**, precision DAC outputs, and robust front-end conditioning for instrumentation-grade testing.

---

### Outcome
A **feature-complete, generation-centric platform** that combines waveform generation, advanced noise synthesis, modulation, and analytics—portable across Windows and Linux, optimized for engineering, research, and test environments.
